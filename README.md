# win-airpods-tap-mute
Mute microphone of your AirPods connected to Windows on double tap

Implemented using https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L

Use `enumerate.ahk` to find the ID of your AirPods
Put the desirable microphone id to `mute.ahk` (replace default `12` value) - you can set the level of AirPods to say 42 and search for 42 in `enumerate.ahk` output

Use `mute.ahk` to mute or unmute your microphone on double tap
